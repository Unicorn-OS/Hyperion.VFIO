THE SKELETON DIRECTORY
  Any files present in the directory /etc/xen-tools/skel will be copied
 across to each new guest image.  The role of this directory is analogous
 to the /etc/skel directory.
  A typical use for this would be to copy a public key across to each
 new system.  You could do this by running:

# Cryptography

# LVM Thin
